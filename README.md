# hello-world

Hello!

My name is Ariannemae Alocillo from Cotcoton, Alegria Cebu, and I am a sophomore at University of Cebu-Main. I am taking Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I am especially interested in programming with the language java and webdesign using html and javascript. I am hoping to be able to enhance any skills in that area, and to learn other languages aside from what I know.
